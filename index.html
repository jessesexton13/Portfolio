    <h2> Hi! I'm Jesse Sexton.</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Thinkful student living in Atlanta, Georgia. My goals as a student are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to become a full-stack engineer</li>
      <li>Gain the knowledge and skills to impress future interviewers throughout my career</li>
      <li>Build a network of link-minded developers that I can become friends with and learn from for many years to come</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you would like to connect with me or have any advice on how to better my chances of a successful career, please email me <a href= "mailto:jessescse@gmail.com"> here</a>.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section>
    <p>
      After graduating high school, I continued my working career. I worked in many fields as a restaurant manager, contractor, home inspector, and several other jobs that taugh me a myriad of skills.
    </p>

    <section>
    <p>
      All throughout these different career paths, I was pursuing the dream of becoming a musician. I achieved that dream in different ways such as signing a song-writing deal with a publisher, playing epic shows before Atlanta Braves games all over the city, and recording dozens of profressional-grade tracks with my band, Subtle Jones. You can find our music featured on our publisher's homepage <a href= "http://www.amuxepublishing.com/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, after years of watching one of my closest friends work as a software engineer and having many conversations where he made his case for me to pursue it as well, I've done just that and started my training with Thinkful to begin a new, life-long lasting career.
